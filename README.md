# IST303TeamProject_RFx
1. Team Members
  My team members are Mohammed Alfawzan and Akhilesh Prakash Rajeswari.

2. Come up with a concept for your application.
  ArcGIS offers users to ability to leverage raster imagery data from data extraction, preparation, visualization to analysis. 
  On ArcGIS Pro, these imagery capabilities are inplemented as a group of raster functions, divided to various categories based on their application fields. 
  Each raster function has a set of parameters and its associated required data type.

  For an example of an raster function, check out documentation on clip raster function (https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/raster-functions/clip-function.htm). 

  **In each release of ArcGIS Pro, the parameters and its required data types might go through some tweaks here and there. 
  We need something like a web database app that tracks the development of raster function changes across different releases of Pros. **
   
3. Identify all the relevant project stakeholders.

  The key stakeholder in this project is Imagery/Raster team at Esri, and whoever that uses raster functions internally in Esri (could be other develpoment teams).

4. Create an initial set of project requirements expressed as user stories. User stories must have estimates of completion times.

  1) (TE: one week) As a user, I want to have a SQL database that provides easy lookup of all raster functions and their parameters in all the previous ArcGIS Pro releases
  2) (TE: one week) As a user, I want to have a Tool owner page that allows me to assign a raster function to a function owner (developer)
  3) (TE: one week) As a user, I want to have a Function property Lookup page that offers a filtering and search capability that finds the specific function I want to look for
  4) (TE: one week) As a user, I want to have a comparison page that generates the changes in between releases
