# Raster Function Tracker for ArcGIS Pro

## Introduction

This application serves as a comprehensive tool designed to track and manage the evolution of raster functions within ArcGIS Pro. Our objective is to harness the vast potential of raster imagery data, which is essential for spatial analysis and geospatial data management. The tool will function as a dynamic repository for documenting changes in raster function parameters and maintaining a clear record of ownership and contact information for each function across different releases.

## Application Concept Overview

At the heart of our application lies the objective to harness the power of raster imagery data within ArcGIS Pro. These capabilities are encapsulated in a suite of raster functions, categorized by their use cases, each with unique parameters and required data types. Given the iterative nature of ArcGIS Pro's development, these raster functions are subject to modifications across releases, necessitating a tool that meticulously tracks these changes. Our web database application aims to fulfill this need, serving as a dynamic repository and reference for raster function evolution, ownership, and contact details.

## Stakeholder Identification

Central to this endeavor are the Imagery/Raster team at Esri and various internal teams reliant on raster functions. Their insights and needs inform the core of our development, ensuring our tool remains relevant and valuable.

## Project Requirements and User Journeys

Our journey to revolutionize raster functionality tracking in ArcGIS Pro begins with defining clear, time-estimated user stories:

- **Week 1:** Develop a comprehensive database encompassing all raster functions and parameters from previous ArcGIS Pro releases.
- **Week 2:** Introduce a Tool Owner page, enabling the assignment of raster functions to specific owners.
- **Week 3:** Enhance the Tool Owner page with capabilities to search, filter, and update owner details.
- **Week 4-5:** Implement a comparison feature to discern differences between two software releases regarding raster functions and parameters.

## Tasks Breakdown

Here's how we break down our tasks according to the user stories:

- **Week 1 Tasks:** 
  - Design database schema.
  - Parse XML data for raster functions.
  - Convert XML data to JSON format.
  - Implement RFX info retrieval and display logic.

[Continue with the rest of the tasks for other weeks as outlined above]

## Development Milestones

We've established robust test plans and integrated testing throughout the development process to ensure functionality and reliability. We're also monitoring progress through a burn-down chart, adjusting tasks and timelines as needed to maintain momentum and achieve project milestones efficiently.

## Task Allocation

- **Aote:** Focus on database schema design and implementation (Tasks A1, B1).
- **Mohammed:** Lead the development of the UI for the Tool Owner page and comparison feature (Tasks B2, D2).
- **Aote:** Handle data parsing, conversion, and logic implementation (Tasks A2, A3, D1).
- **Akilesh:** Work on search, filter, and update functionalities (Tasks C1, C2).
- **Mohammed:** Presentation design and overall concept delivery.

## Monitoring Progress with a Burn-Down Chart

_The burn-down chart above illustrates our team's current progress against the planned work, offering a clear visual of the remaining tasks over the project timeline._

## Documentation of Stand-Up Meetings

We have documented the agendas, decisions, and action items from our bi-weekly stand-up meetings. These documents are a testament to our team's ongoing communication and problem-solving process.

## Development and Testing Environment Setup

Our development environment is fully configured, complete with the necessary software installations, access permissions, and initial database setups. We have included basic functional and test code in our repository to validate the setup's effectiveness.
